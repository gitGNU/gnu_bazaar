Bazaar is an easy to use and powerful abstraction layer between
relational database and object oriented application.

Bazaar maps tables into classes, table rows into class objects and
creates one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many associations between
objects. Several tasks on objects can be performed, such as filtering
(querying) and sorting objects using database query language.

Bazaar supports GUI development with set of powerful widgets designed
to simplify development of objects presentation, manipulation and
searching.
