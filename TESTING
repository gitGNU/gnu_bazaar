PostgreSQL RDBMS and psycopg Python module are used below below.

1. Create test database, i.e. bazaar:

    $ cd bazaar
    $ dropdb bazaar
    $ createdb -E utf-8 bazaar
    $ psql -f test/sql/init.sql bazaar
    $ python -O test/sql/fill.py psycopg 'dbname = bazaar'

2. You can edit test/bazaar.ini to suit your needs.

3. Run all tests:
    export PYTHONPATH=src
    python src/bazaar/test/bzr.py test/bazaar.ini -- -v
